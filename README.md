# Ex Libris Primo JavaScript Files

This is a collection of miscellaneous JavaScript files to enhance the Primo 4 user experience.

The scripts are written in CoffeeScript in the [coffeescript](coffeescript) directory and automatically compiled to JavaScript in the [javascript](javascript) directory.

## send_to_links

Primo has a helpful dropdown of links providing features such as email, print, citation, permalink, etc.  By default this dropdown is only available after clicking on a record's detail tab.  This script adds a version of the dropdown links at the record level so users can access the functionality without clicking on the detail tab.
